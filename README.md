# Notice

If you are heavily using k8s and adopting microservices architecture, we recommend you to upgrade to use [Nightingale](https://github.com/ccfos/nightingale) building your modern monitoring system.

- [Nightingale](https://github.com/ccfos/nightingale) is an enterprise-level cloud-native monitoring tool, which can be used as drop-in replacement of Prometheus for alerting and management.
- [Categraf](https://github.com/flashcatcloud/categraf) is one-stop telemetry collector for Nightingale / Prometheus / M3DB / VictoriaMetrics / Thanos / Influxdb / TDengine.

It is recommended that you use [FlashDuty](https://flashcat.cloud/product/flashduty?from=categraf) as the OnCall system to realize alarm aggregation convergence, claiming, upgrading, scheduling, and coordination, so that the alarm can be reached efficiently and ensure that the alarm processing is not missed.

```
export WorkDir="$HOME/open-falcon"
mkdir -p $WorkDir
tar -xzvf open-falcon-vx.x.x.tar.gz -C $WorkDir
cd $WorkDir

```
cd $WorkDir
./open-falcon start

# check modules status
./open-falcon check
